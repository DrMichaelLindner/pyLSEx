#	Python based Lindenmayer system Explorer

##	This GUI based toolbox is designed to either generate new or modify
##	existing Lindemayer systems/grammars. 

Lindenmayer System Generator:
    Using the Generator you can generate predefined Lindenmayer systems 
    (e.g. Fibonacci) or you can define your own rules to create grammars. 

Lindenmayer System Modifier:
    Using the Modifier you can change and modify existing L-systems, by 
    building rules to iteratively replace chains of n characters of the 
    system with chains of m other ones. 
    
See detailed description about the usage and the parameters that can be 
specified in the User Manual or by pressing the help button.
