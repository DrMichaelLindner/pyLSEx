##	Lindenmayer system Explorer for Python

This GUI based toolbox for python 2.7 is designed to either generate new or modify existing Lindenmayer systems/grammars. 

*Lindenmayer System Generator:*    
    Using the Generator you can generate predefined Lindenmayer systems 
    (e.g. Fibonacci) or you can define your own rules to create grammars. 

*Lindenmayer System Modifier:*    
    Using the Modifier you can change and modify existing L-systems, by 
    building rules to iteratively replace chains of n characters of the 
    system with chains of m other ones. 
    
See detailed description about the usage in the [Wiki](https://github.com/DrMichaelLindner/pyLSEx/wiki), 
in the User Manual (pdf) or by pressing the help button on the GUI menubar.
